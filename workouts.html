          tends to be thin, and struggles to gain weight as either
          body fat or muscle. They can eat piles of food and stay looking the

          build that includes the best of
          both worlds. They tend to have wide shoulders, a narrow waist,
          relatively thin joints, and round muscle bellies. In short, if you're
          a mesomorph, you have a natural tendency to be fit and relatively
          muscular.
